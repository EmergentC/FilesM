In Homer's Odyssey, Scylla is a six-headed monster who lives in a cave on a cliff face overlooking a narrow strait. Odysseus and his crew must navigate this strait, and Scylla snatches six of his men as they pass by. She is one of two dangers in the strait, the other being the whirlpool Charybdis, and Odysseus is advised to hug Scylla's cliffside to minimize the loss of his ship and crew
